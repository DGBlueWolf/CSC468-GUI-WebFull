    <h2>Space</h2>
    <h2>Loading and Saving</h2>
    <p>
        Click `Load` to upload an Potato XML config file. Click `Save` to Download XML for the current potato.
    </p>
    <h2>Presets</h2>
    <p>
        Pressing `Default` will give the `Default` potato which is shown at startup for new users. Pressing `Frosh` will 
        display an alternative preset. `Reset` will set the screen to a blank potato.
    </p>
    <h2>Selecting Componet</h2>
    <p>
        You can select the current active component by clicking on the button on the top of the left-hand menu. This button displays
        the name of the current component. The current component filters which components can be added.
    </p>
    <h2>Adding Components</h2>
    <p>
        You can add a component by pressing `Add` and selecting the component you want to add. What you can `Add` is dependent on your current selection.
        Components can also be removed by replacing them with a simpler element.
    </p>
    <h2>Remove</h2>
    <p>
        While this doesn't work, you should be able to press `Remove` and it will remove the current element as long as 
        the element is not a base element.
